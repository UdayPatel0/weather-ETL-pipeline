# 🌦️ Weather ETL Pipeline

This project is a simple, modular ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built in Python. It fetches real-time weather data from the **Open-Meteo API**, processes the data using **Pandas**, and stores it into a local **SQLite** database. The entire pipeline is scheduled to run **automatically every day** using the `schedule` library.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Extract** real-time weather data from an open API
- ✅ **Transform** the JSON response into clean tabular format
- ✅ **Load** data into an SQLite database
- ✅ **Schedule** the job to run daily using Python
- ✅ Lightweight, no API key or authentication needed

---

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Python ETL fundamentals
- Working with REST APIs using `requests`
- Data cleaning & transformation with `pandas`
- SQLite integration
- Task scheduling with `schedule`
- Exception handling & modular code design
